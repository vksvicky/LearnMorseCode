## Troubleshooting

### Microphone and Speech Recognition Issues

The Voice → Morse feature requires microphone and speech recognition permissions. If you're experiencing issues, follow these troubleshooting steps:

#### 🔧 **Issue: App Crashes on Voice → Morse Tab**

**Symptoms**: App crashes immediately when accessing Voice → Morse tab with error about missing usage descriptions.

**Solution**:
1. **Open the project in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open LearnMorseCode.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Add Privacy Usage Descriptions**:
   - Select the **LearnMorseCode** project (top item in navigator)
   - Select the **LearnMorseCode** target
   - Go to **Build Settings** tab
   - Search for `infoplist`
   - Under **Info.plist Values**, add these keys:
     - **Key**: `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description`
       **Value**: `This app uses the microphone to record your voice for speech recognition and Morse code learning.`
     - **Key**: `Privacy - Speech Recognition Usage Description`
       **Value**: `This app uses speech recognition to convert your voice to text, which is then translated to Morse code for learning purposes.`

3. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   # In Xcode: Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
   # Then build and run again (Cmd+R)
   ```

#### 🔧 **Issue: App Not Listed in System Settings**

**Symptoms**: App doesn't appear in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone or Speech Recognition.

**Root Cause**: App is signed with "adhoc" signature instead of proper developer certificate.

**Solution**:
1. **Set up Code Signing in Xcode** (Recommended):
   - Follow the detailed guide: [Code Signing Setup Guide](Docs/setup_xcode_signing.md)
   - Open project in Xcode
   - Select **LearnMorseCode** target
   - Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
   - ✅ Check **"Automatically manage signing"**
   - Select your **Apple ID** in the Team dropdown
   - If you don't see your Apple ID, click **"Add Account..."** and sign in

2. **Quick Helper Script**:
   ```bash
   ./Scripts/grant_permissions_manual.sh
   ```
   This script will open System Settings to the microphone section and provide guidance.

3. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   # In Xcode: Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
   # Then build and run again (Cmd+R)
   ```

3. **Verify in System Settings**:
   - Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Microphone**
   - You should now see **"LearnMorseCode"** in the list
   - Toggle the switch **ON** to grant permission
   - Repeat for **Speech Recognition** if it's a separate entry

#### 🔧 **Issue: "No Speech Detected" Error**

**Symptoms**: App starts recording but shows "No speech detected" even when speaking.

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. **Check Microphone Hardware**:
   ```bash
   # Test with QuickTime Player
   # Open QuickTime Player → File → New Audio Recording
   # Click record and speak - you should see audio levels
   ```

2. **Check System Input Levels**:
   - Go to **System Settings** → **Sound** → **Input**
   - Speak and verify the input level meter moves
   - Ensure input volume is not muted

3. **Check App Permissions**:
   - Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Microphone**
   - Verify **LearnMorseCode** is listed and enabled
   - Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Speech Recognition**
   - Verify **LearnMorseCode** is listed and enabled

4. **Test with Different Audio Devices**:
   - In the app, try selecting different audio input devices from the dropdown
   - Test with both built-in microphone and any external microphones

#### 🔧 **Issue: Volume Level Always Shows 0%**

**Symptoms**: Volume level indicator in the app always shows 0% even when speaking.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Wrong Audio Device Selected**:
   - Check the audio device dropdown in the app
   - Try selecting different devices (Built-in Microphone, External Microphone, etc.)
   - Test each device by speaking

2. **Microphone Permissions Not Granted**:
   - Follow the "App Not Listed in System Settings" solution above
   - Ensure proper code signing is set up

3. **Audio Device Hardware Issue**:
   - Test microphone with other apps (QuickTime, FaceTime, etc.)
   - Check if microphone works with Siri
   - Try unplugging and reconnecting external microphones

#### 🔧 **Issue: Speech Recognition Not Working**

**Symptoms**: Microphone works but speech is not being recognized or converted to text.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Speech Recognition Permissions**:
   - Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Speech Recognition**
   - Ensure **LearnMorseCode** is listed and enabled

2. **Test Speech Recognition System-Wide**:
   - Try using **Dictation** in any text field (press Fn twice)
   - If system dictation doesn't work, there may be a system-level issue

3. **Check Internet Connection**:
   - Speech recognition may require internet connection for some features
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection

4. **Restart the App**:
   - Quit the app completely
   - Reopen and try again

#### 🔧 **Issue: Audio Device Dropdown is Empty**

**Symptoms**: The audio device selection dropdown shows no options.

**Solution**:
1. **Restart the App**:
   - Quit the app completely
   - Reopen and navigate to Voice → Morse tab
   - The dropdown should populate with available devices

2. **Check Audio System**:
   - Go to **System Settings** → **Sound** → **Input**
   - Verify that input devices are detected by the system

#### 🔧 **Issue: App Shows Generic Device Names**

**Symptoms**: Dropdown shows "Default Input Device", "Built-in Microphone" instead of actual device names.

**Note**: This is expected behavior. The app uses generic device names that work across different Mac models to ensure compatibility.

**Verification**:
- The generic names still correspond to your actual hardware
- "Built-in Microphone" = your Mac's internal microphone
- "External Microphone" = any connected external microphones
- "Default Input Device" = system's current default input

#### 🔧 **Advanced Troubleshooting**

If the above steps don't resolve the issue:

1. **Reset Privacy Permissions**:
   ```bash
   # Reset all privacy permissions (use with caution)
   sudo tccutil reset All com.your-bundle-id.LearnMorseCode
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Open **Console.app**
   - Filter for "LearnMorseCode"
   - Look for error messages related to audio or speech recognition

3. **Test with Minimal Setup**:
   - Disconnect all external audio devices
   - Use only the built-in microphone
   - Test in a quiet environment

4. **System Requirements Check**:
   - Ensure macOS 14.0 or later
   - Check that you have sufficient disk space
   - Verify system audio is working properly

#### 🔧 **Development-Specific Issues**

If you're developing the app:

1. **Code Signing Issues**:
   - Ensure you're using a valid Apple Developer certificate
   - Check that the bundle identifier matches your provisioning profile
   - Verify that the app is not running in "adhoc" mode

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Ensure privacy usage descriptions are properly set in build settings
   - Check that the app target includes required frameworks (AVFoundation, Speech)

3. **Testing on Different Machines**:
   - Test on different Mac models to ensure compatibility
   - Verify that the app works with different audio hardware configurations

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check the Console**: Look for error messages in Console.app
2. **Test with Other Apps**: Verify that your microphone works with other applications
3. **System Updates**: Ensure your macOS is up to date
4. **Report Issues**: Open an issue on GitHub with:
   - macOS version
   - Mac model
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Console error messages (if any)
   - Screenshots of System Settings permissions
